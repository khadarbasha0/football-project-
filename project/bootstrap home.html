                    <h5 class="text-primary">WON THE MATCH WIN THE PRIZE 50,000/-</h5>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game
                    played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the
                    centre
                    of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails
                    balanced
                    on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball<br> bowled at one of the wickets
                    with
                    the bat and then <br>running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to
                    prevent
                    this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and
                    dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being<br> bowled, when the ball
                    hits
                    the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it
                    is
                    hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter
                    can
                    cross the crease in front <br>of the wicket.<br> When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends
                    and
                    the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, a<br>ided by a third umpire and match
                    referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the
                    match's
                    statistical information.<br>

                    Forms of cricket range from Twenty20 (also known as T20), with each team batting for a single
                    innings of 20 overs (each "over" being a set of<br> 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to
                    score)
                    and the game generally lasting three to four hours, to Test matches played over five days.
                    Traditionally<br> cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or
                    team
                    colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury
                    caused by
                    the ball, which is a hard, solid spher<br>oid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn
                    seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.

                    The earliest known definite reference to cricket is to it being played in South East England in
                    the
                    mid-16th century.<br><br>

                    It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first
                    international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the
                    International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full
                    members<br>
                    who play Test matches. The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone
                    Cricket
                    Club (MCC) in London. The sport<br> is followed primarily in South Asia, Australia, New Zealand, the
                    United Kingdom, Southern Africa and the West Indies.<br>

                    Women's cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international
                    standard.<br>

                    The most successful side playing international cricket is Australia, which has won eight One Day
                    International trophies, including six World Cups, more than any other country and has been the
                    top-rated Test side more than any other country.[citation needed]

                    A medieval "club ball" game involving an underarm bowl towards a batter. Ball catchers are shown
                    positioning themselves to catch a ball. Detail from the Canticles<br> of Holy Mary, 13th century.
                    Cricket is one of many games in the "club ball" sphere that basically involve hitting.
